### Surveyed Publications data visualization

YearGraphs

    documentation and code for the following types of data visualizations:

    - Stacked Bar Chart
    - Grouped Bar Chart
    - Line Chart
    - Heat Map

    The visualizations rely on a CSV file with the columns: 
    - Year
    - Technology
    - Conference
    - DOI 

StackedBar

    A standalone variant of the Stacked Bar Chart with additional filtering by 'Conference.'


CSV files should live in a `CSV_Files` folder within the root directory.  
Example path: `../CSV_Files/NVM_data.csv`

See our Tutorial.py tool guide for more on graph manipulation.
