Application Data Exploration

The folder contains:
- NVMsum_J.ipynb
    run with -> jupyter notebook
- NVMsum_S.py
    run with -> bokeh serve --show NVMsum_S.py

They both contain the same graph: jupyter notebook to see the code with the graph, and the standalone python file to only see the graph

The graph presents application-level data from NVMExplorer, run with all technology, all optimization targets, all benchmarks, and all capacities.
