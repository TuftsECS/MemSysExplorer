### MemSysExplorer Website Repo

The Website subdirectory contians the documentation and code for the visualizations used in the MemSysExplorer application. 

The MemSysExplorer application is a web-based interactive tool tutorial application. 
    It has static datasets, documentation, and explanation of collected data.
    Please use our tutorial page to learn how to use the various bokeh visualizations. 

The Website repo on Github is the extendable, open-source version. We hope these tools are useful for learning, research, and development. 
    The visualizations are dynamic and compatible with data from other sources. 
    Each subdirectory contians a README with more specific information.

    Sample data files in "CSV_files" may be modified/replaced. View each graph's comments for column name dependencies.
